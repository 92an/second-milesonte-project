4. Select branch you want to deploy (Master in my case).
5. Select the folder (/root) to deploy.
6. Save changes, and there is a link to the deployed website (see href above).

See documentation for publishing to Github Pages [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)

## deploy repository locally by cloning directory:
1. Go to the github repository.
2. Click on code.
3. Copy the url to the repository https://github.com/92an/second-milesonte-project.git.
4. Open up your local comand promt (Bash in my case).
5. Make sure to change working directory to the one you want to clone the directory to.
6. type the command git clone https://github.com/92an/second-milesonte-project.git

## Libraries and Frameworks:
* Bootstrap
* Jquery
* Font Awesome

## Tools
* Visual Studio code
* Git
* Github
* Chrome Dev Tools

# Project Purpose:

A math game aimed at 2nd to 3rd graders, which is an age group of 6 â€“ 9 years old. Acting as supplementary material to class giving dynamic questions with instantaneous feedback on the 4 core operators; addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

# Business Case:

Since looking at numbers from 2019 roughly 600 000 people are between the ages 5 -9 in Sweden; putting the squarely in the market demographic and are potential users of the app. Teaching is in addition an underappreciated profession. This app seeks to alleviate some of the burden on teachers by providing a dynamic set of practice question to work with. This creates space for teachers to focus on the how to solve a question rather than provide materials to practice on. Providing this app at a cheap price would make it lucrative, since integrating technology and education is an underutilized market.

# Design principles/features:

* Simple design to eliminate busywork, focus on core features.

* Menu is simple, such that it only provides access to the game modes in big colorful buttons.

* Streamlined gameplay loop that generates 10 questions in the four core operations.

* Addition only sums up to 100.

* Subtraction has no negative numbers.

* Multiplication only has the standard times table up to 10.

* Division only has numbers that are divisible.

* Instantaneous feedback if right or wrong and return back to menu when all 10 questions are answered.

# User Stories:

* As a teacher I would want it to generate appropriate problems for my math class to ease my workload.

* As a parent I want the application to be safe and child friendly.

* As a user the game should provide feedback as to know if the answer submitted is right or wrong.

* As a user I would want to easily access the different game modes from the menu to focus on a specific area of math.

# Future Features:

* Scalable difficulty

* Additional game modes such as:
	* Subtraction allowing the answer to be negative.
	* Allowing subtraction with negative numbers.
	* Addition with 3 numbers.
	* Measurement conversion.
	* Checking prime numbers.
